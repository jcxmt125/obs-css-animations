            <p>
                ...With that out of the way, hi!<br>
                This is a collection of <a class="extLink" href="https://github.com/jcxmt125/obs-css-animations">open source</a> animations <a class="extLink" href="https://hackclub.com/arcade">Hack club High seas</a>!</a><br>
                It's made up of simple HTML and some CSS... so, no JS... mostly.<br>
                As stated below, Cloudflare analytics are used to track whether this website breaks in your usage, whether I didn't cause extreme buffering with an update, etc.<br>
                This will load JS in your browser!<br>
                If you don't want this, either disable JS for this website, use ublock or similar to block this, or download and import the html as an OBS source. (It's open source for a reason!)<br>
                Now, the animation links.
            </p>

                Oh hey... keen to learn more?<br>
                This page is hosted on Cloudflare pages free tier. Something like Github pages... but Cloudflare.<br>
                They do claim to have infinite bandwidth, as long as the page is truly static... I've seen stories of it not being quite infinite, but I don't expect that much traffic...<br>
                In any case, the Github repo should be up no matter what (unless GH collapses), so you can always clone and use this webpage locally.<br>
                It's literally all HTML and CSS, so it should "just work", even completely offline as a pure "html source".<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                Oh, and about what I track... it's mostly loading times for this website, and what browsers you visit here from.<br>
                I might also get some information about where you live, from IP information, but I can't see your actual IP address.<br>
                Anyways, happy coding! Or broadcasting. You know, <i>Open broadcasting software</i>?
