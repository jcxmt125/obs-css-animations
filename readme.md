# CSS animations for use in OBS

## Why?
I like using OBS virtual cameras for... all manners of online conferencing needs.
I tend to link a lot of cameras (and virtual "cameras", as well as input sources) together for a fun experience.
However, sometimes I want... animations.
Maybe a camera went out and I need to show a "camera off" screen (no, the default for the programs aren't pretty enough)?

## How?
